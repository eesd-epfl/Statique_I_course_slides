# Project name

These are presentations developed for teaching the course Statique I (Static I) at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne to first year civil engineering students. 

## Usage

These presentations are intended for teaching a basic course on structural analysis of statically determinate structures to civil engineering students. The course duration is 2h / week over a 14 week semester. It is accompagnied by exercises of also 2h / week. The course builds on the book « Statique appliquée (TGC Volume 1) – Analyse des structures et milieux continus » de François Frey (https://www.epflpress.org/produit/56/9782880748968/statique-appliquee-tgc-volume-1 ) but can be also used with other books. The exercises are largely taken from this book and from a booklet that is shared here: https://github.com/eesd-epfl/Statique_I
